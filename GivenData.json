Despite multiple attempts to resolve these matters over the phone, I have not received the necessary assistance to correct the inaccuracies on my account. \n\nXXXX. Disputed Charge and Lack of Support : I have called Macys customer service many times to dispute a charge of {$31.00} and address other concerns. Each time, the representatives were either unwilling or unable to assist me effectively. Macys should have records of these calls to verify my repeated efforts. \nXXXX. Late Fee : I acknowledge the late fee of {$31.00} charged on XX/XX/year>, and its subsequent credit on XX/XX/year>. However, this does not resolve the main issue of incorrect reporting. \nXXXX Credit Reporting Inaccuracy : My account was reported as 30 days delinquent in XX/XX/year>. I have consistently disputed this information, stating that payments for XXXX and XX/XX/year> were made but not properly applied to my account. \n\nAdditional Impact : Due to this delinquency on my credit report, my auto insurance increased to {$330.00} per month. This has been a significant financial burden. \n\nI request that Macys conduct a comprehensive review, including the phone call records, and correct the inaccuracies on my account. Additionally, I request the removal of the disputed by consumer note from my credit report once the issue is resolved. \n\nAdditionally, I do not want any Macys advertisements sent to my apartment. \n\nI hope to resolve this matter amicably and promptly. Thank you for your attention to this important issue. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

And I also checked the correct dates were actually not available to book, so there was no way to ask for a modification of my booking. Since it was midnight and no XXXX customer agents were available at that time, I only had to contact XXXX  credit card customer service to ask if there was anything they could do to help me with this case. \n\nThe agent on the call, the agent assured me that in this case, I could wait a few days for the pending charge to be posted, and cancel the service and submit a dispute, and eventually get money back with XXXX help. I was hopeful from what the agent told me, so I did what she told me to do, saw the pending charge posted on XX/XX/XXXX, canceled the stay with XXXX the same day, tried to work with them to get the dates modified or get the full refund but all failed. So I submitted a dispute, hoping to get my money back through my bank. After waiting for a few months, I got a rejection from XXXX for my dispute. I called XXXX customer service again to explain what happened and what the previous agent promised me. The new agent asked me to re-open the dispute by submitting supporting documents, which I did what she said. The case was re-opened but I was not being contacted or notified for the final results. I have been tracking the dispute process on my app though for a few months, and no updates until recently, the case was closed quietly. No notification, no contact from the bank, it secretly closed. And of course, I did not get my money back or even get an explanation. \n\nSince I did not actually stay at the property, I believe they did not have any losses due to this however, I lost {$XXXX} for nothing. XXXX it was caused by my own mistake in the first place, but I acted very quickly to try to correct the mistake, although the policy was too strict for me to do so. Moreover, what the first agent told me made me feel confident to get my money back with XXXX help, which turned out to be not, which is very frustrating : (. And the fact that no communication afterward is also frustrating. I hope XXXX  can help me get my money back as I indeed did not use the service at all. \n\nAlso I was unfortunately impacted by a mass layoff in XX/XX/XXXX, and not yet found a job due to the harsh market. {$XXXX} bucks would really mean a lot to me at this challenging time. I sincerely appreciate it.",

I perform exceptionally. \nThis is an unfair and abusive practice. In addition, I called the bank and the agent said they can not tell me why my credit card was closed.

Aspire Financial did not provide me with this opportunity, nor did I give any consent for my information to be shared. \n\nAspire Financial has shared my personal and financial information with credit reporting agencies without my explicit consent, violating 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ). \n\nLack of XXXX XXXX : I was not given the required opportunity to opt out of having my information shared with non-affiliated third parties. Additionally, I never received my forms to opt out. This opportunity should have been clear and conspicuous, and it was not. Signing a contract that states the company \" may '' report does not suffice under this law. \n\nI request that Aspire Financial cease the unauthorized sharing of my information immediately and take corrective actions to rectify the negative impact on my credit report. I also request written confirmation that my complaint has been received and is being addressed. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your timely response. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",

            "complaint_what_happened": "I am XXXX XXXX. My father ( XXXX XXXX ) and mother ( XXXX XXXX ) have had a CitiAdvantage Gold Card account with Citibank, NA since XX/XX/XXXX. My father passed away on XX/XX/XXXX. Of course, XXXX XXXX has continued to use the account under the assumption that it was a joint account. Yet, when Citi kept sending cards in her deceased husband 's name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) called the Citi number to ask them to stop sending cards in his name. She had no intention to close the account. When her call was routed to Citi 's overseas call center, the agent confused her by rushing to close the account. This is when we learned that it was not a \" joint account '', but rather XXXX was the account holder and XXXX an additional cardholder. \n\nSo, Citi 's agent closes the account immediately and this causes all credit card statements and online access to their account to stop too. XXXX XXXX asks what is owed so she can send a check, which she did to pay off the account. Unbeknownst to widow XXXX, Citi had caused a {$1.00} cent charge to be assessed to the closed account for interest. As if that was not unscrupulous enough, Citi then tacked on a {$30.00} late fee on the account and sent it to XXXX XXXX XXXX to collect on a {$31.00} amount that it generated after closing the account and while they left all of the cardholder 's relatives in the dark as to anything related to the account. \n\nIn an attempt to alleviate XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX about her account being closed ( and prior to Citi 's XX/XX/XXXX surprise collection letter ), I called Citi to request online access or paper copies of statements so that XXXX XXXX would have them for her records and tax purposes. After being bounced around from the offshore agents to different departments at Citi ( forced to re-verify the account information, SSNs, etc. each time I was transferred ), I landed at the Citi Probate Dept where I was advised that the account was closed with nothing outstanding, so XXXX would have to fax a request for statements along with more proof of identity within the written requests. We did so immediately. \n\nSeveral weeks after sending the faxed request, widow XXXX received in the mail the requested statements a cover letter addressed to now-deceased Dad XXXX XXXX XXXX Citibank NA dated XX/XX/XXXX, in which it claim astonishingly claimed that Citi was owed an outstanding debt of {$31.00}. When I checked the statements that were never sent to the family of XXXX XXXX or viewable online due to the account closure, I discovered that Citibank had snuck this de minimis interest charge of {$1.00} to the account and then ballooned it by over XXXX to make it this contrived and eggregious {$31.00} debt. \n\nObviously and predictably, the Citibank Probate/Estate Department knowingly and with utter disregard sent this reasonably requested packet of recent account statements with a COLLECTION LETTER to the widow, causing her panic and fear and even tears. As her son and being a transactional lawyer, I felt like this should be easy to resolve with a call to Citi. Since doing so last Friday, I have been bounced around from Citi 's overseas agents to their US agents, from one department to another ( Estates Team, Internal Probate, and other names used ), and eventually to someone that appears to have been with XXXX The lengthy ( hour-plus ) effort to navigate Citi 's labyrinth looking for someone at Citi to do the responsible thing and zero out the account while reversing the collection orders all led me to be transferred a man at XXXX XXXX ( ID XXXX ), who was rude throughout. Though I had verified the account and the private information about my father to establish who I was and that I was in fact speaking on behalf of the estate for my father 's account, he asked for even more by insisting upon knowing the date of death of my father. i do not retain that so I immediately searched for it. After a minute of looking while strongly suggesting that he in the meantime work on closing the collection effort so we did not waste everyone 's time exposing Citi 's misconduct more publicly, he got angry and then stated \" you have exceeded the allotted time to verify the account '' - notwithstanding the fact that I had given him the SSN, card/account number with security code/DOB, etc. Conveniently for him, he terminated the call a couple of minutes before XXXX pm when their offices closed for the weekend. So, I was not able to get anyone at Citi or XXXX on the phone until this week. \n\nUpon calling today to the XXXX number that Citi had given me ( XXXX ), a nice agent \" Precious '' was not finding the account by any of XXXX XXXX 's personally identifying information or the account number. After much time looking, the signal dropped and the call disconnected. So, I called back and got another nice person, who too could not find the account. So, I called the Citi Estates Team number and got a woman named XXXX. She could not do anything on the account and suggested I contact XXXX, so I reiterated that I had called them on the number I got from Citi, and had been transferred to them directly from Citi. Plus, when I called the number on the XX/XX/XXXX collection letter from Citi, it had a fax dial tone ( multiple attempts made ). So, this person transferred me again to the \" Probate Specialist '' at XXXX who again was not able to find anything with my father XXXX 's Citibank account information. \n\nBecause I have now wasted hours of time and endured the pain of many days of anxiety by my beautiful mother, I am just redirecting my time into this complaint, which I will also attach to a letter to Citi to put them on notice of their harrasment, abusive debt collection practices, shady interest/late fees on this closed account of a deceased cardholder without regard for the widow and family dealing with Citibank 's abuses. Citibank should immediately remove the charges its processes affixed to a deceased account holder 's ledger after telling the family that the account was closed with no amounts owing, plus what I suggest below.",

The charge was for charging an electric vehicle some place outside of XXXX where I live. I do not own an EV nor has there ever been an EV charge on my account. I have plenty of gas station charges, however. I immediately called and confirmed that this was in fact a fraudulent charge. I closed the account, and they reissued another card and account number. \n\nFast forward, they reversed the credit they issued. I called on XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed this. They told me that the merchant sent in a receipt for the charge. The receipt is nothing more than a receipt. No signature. It is not sufficient evidence ( I am an XXXX ) to support I was there and made the charge. On the call, I explained that a receipt does not mean I made the purchase. They agreed and were supposed to give me credit. \n\nI just received my statement yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX. The credit has been reversed again! I talked with a few people at Citi yesterday and was told that because I did not respond to a letter they sent by XX/XX/XXXX, it was my fault. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX which they have noted in the system. I explained again that this charge should never have been on my account since they knew it was fraudulent even before I did. I called immediately to confirm it was fraudulent. They are now saying they will resubmit the credit again and it will take XXXX  days to receive. This is outrageous! I have spent XXXX hours on this already, and they are hoping to wear me down or I will forget. This is not ethical in any way. \n\nPLEASE investigate Citi. I feel certain this is probably more widespread than me given the reponses from employees. THis is not a mistake. This is their practice now. You could ask for all their fraudulent transaction flags, the list of customers that called to confirm the charges were fraudulent, and then see that they continued to charge the customer hoping they would not notice. ( I am an XXXX. ) They are scamming consumers!!! And it's not right. I have never had an issue like this with a fraudulent charge. Typically, if the company knows it is fraudulent, the charge never hits the account. Also, please encourage consumers to check their statements very carefully.",

Typically, the funds are immediately available and so that is what I expected. However, when the funds were showing as unavailable, I called the number on the back of my XXXX card and I was told the funds would be available the next day, which was also my final day to pay my rent without a late fee being accessed. The next day the funds were still not available so I called again and I was told that there was a hold on the payment and the matter was escalated. The next person told me that they would send an email to the appropriate department requesting the hold be removed and I would get an email on the decision within a few hours. After about 6 or 7 hours, I had received nothing so I called back in and asked to speak to someone in that same escalated department. The gentleman was very rude and he told me that WF should not even be handling my call and they were doing me a favor by taking my call and I actually needed to be calling XXXX directly. I explained that I called the number on the back of my card and he then gave me another number which ultimately brought me back to WF again. At this point, I spoke with a supervisor that explained to me that a possible reason for the hold was a returned payment. In XXXX, I was transitioning to another bank account and I accidentally chose the wrong account to make my payment from. Once I realized the mistake, I immediately corrected it. Once she told me that, I was more understanding of them wanting to verify the funds but I never recieved an email requesting the verification so I ended uo with a late fee being added to XXXX 's rent. The funds would become available 4 days after my initial payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made another payment through the WF portal for {$1000.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the funds are still unavailable and I am now being told there is a 15 day hold on the payment. I was told that if I opened a WF checking or savings account there would be no hold but since I'm paying from an outside bank there is a hold. Even when I went into a WF branch and made a payment to the card using cash, the funds were still not available until the next day. I declined to open an account and reached out to their executive team as suggested by their customer service rep. I was then told it could take up to 30 days for someone to get back to me, and I still have no explanation how the hold went from 4 days the first time and now to 15 days.",

Before I left the XXXX, I visited a Wells Fargo branch to close my checking and savings accounts, paid the outstanding balance of the secured credit card, and subsequently called the phone number on the back of the card to cancel it, which I believed the card will be canceled accordingly. I moved back home in late XX/XX/XXXX and have since never used this Wells Fargo credit card. However, I moved back to the XXXX a few weeks ago and I found my credit score to be substantially low for no reason. I requested a copy of my credit report from CFPB and discovered that Wells Fargo not only did not close my credit card but it had posted a balance of {$160.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, when I had already left the country thinking the credit card had been closed. I have tried to call customer service at Wells Fargo on the phone to file a dispute about this, and they told me to mail the requested information to Wells Fargo Credit Dispute Department, and I will receive a confirmation of receipt from them in a week, I did so and XXXX tracking showed my package was delivered to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, but I have not received any notification since then.",

The rep called in and was only advised that I had to wait for the physical card, entirely defeating the purpose of applying. I completed the purchase with another card and proceeded to call the customer service line at XXXX. The first customer rep I spoke with reached out to another department and could only tell me a security block was placed. At that time I requested a supervisor. The supervisor whose name I believe was XXXX proceeded to give very vague and misleading answers. At first I was told there was multiple systems that the application had to scan through, then told XXXX XXXX systems. He kept stating that he had no information on why the block was placed, then proceeded to tell me it was flagged as fraud. After addressing the lie he told stating he didnt know anything then telling me it was fraud, the rep kept interrupting me and eventually chose to hang up after I said it was XXXX me the XXXXXXXX XXXX that he wouldnt let me finish speaking. \nAfter this interaction I called back in and requested another supervisor. I cant recall the name of the second supervisor but she was more helpful and transferred me to a different department, I believe it was their consumer protection department. This rep then gave very vague answers saying for security reasons I couldnt be verified. I asked for clarification on what couldnt be verified but I was denied any explanation. I was continually told I would be contacted. I then asked how I would be contacted and was told it could be either phone, email, or regular mail. When I asked for clarification on when I should expect a follow up I was told it could take up to a month. I then asked what would happen if I hadnt heard anything within a month and was told Id need to call back in. I asked what would happen at that point given Ive been told I cant be helped over the phone and wasnt given an answer. \n\nAt this point I requested to cancel the card due to the lack of information provided and the overall frustration of the experience. I was denied my request to cancel stating I had to wait for the verification before I could even cancel. \n\nAt this point with no guarantees of any sort of resolution from the company Im resulting to filing this complaint. I was provided with a receipt from the physical store that my application was instantly approved for a {$3500.00} limit, told it could be used for the purchase I was there to make that day, and subsequently denied any explanation from the merchant as to what the issue with my account is despite providing my physical ID in person during the application.",

Citi says they have processed a transaction that XXXX XXXX says is impossible given the card number doesn't exist. \n\nCan anyone help me?",

In the hours that had passed, I can only guess that my balance changed for my debit card, and I had insufficient funds. Amazon decides that if you authorize payment with one financial institution it also means you're authorizing payment on an Amazon Credit Card, a card that I never even activated and never set as a default payment.\n\nAs my Amazon account was through a XXXX  email, I at some point lost access to my account. This seems abusive and it feels like a corporation fishing for low-hanging and financially disadvantaged fruit, especially in the context of users being at checkout, seeing a checkbox saying \" Get {$50.00} for free '', and not realizing it could cost them half a point on their credit score. \n\nIn short : Amazon 's credit card and transaction authorization policies are unethical, and predatory, and lack a clear boundary of consensual payment when handling credit/debit cards from different financial institutions.",

Back at the end of XXXX my card was lost and I contacted Aspire customer service to report that my card was missing, to my surprise I realized that my card was not actually lost that it had been stolen because I had multiple fraudulent transactions, which they happily assisted me with. I received the provisional credit and subsequently received a letter asking me for additional to which I supplied the information requested by the bank. Its been exactly 89 days and my card was lost walking into the mall, I assume as I do not really know the details exactly how the card was lost other than I know my card was missing along with the inner part of my wallet and my id. Not only did they reverse the I ended up having to get a new ID as well. I notified the bank and everything seemed to be ok. I logged into my account this morning to see that my previously resolved case that was credited to my account for the fraud had been reversed and was told even previously told that it was found in my favor. I spoke with Customer Service and they told me and read me the notes from the investigation team that stated because I have another recent claim within 2 months, which it was not, they denied the first claim as well and Reversed it because they claim it could not be fraud. This is absolutely ridiculous. I asked previously if I should file a police report from back in XXXX and was told no, I was again told no on the second report but despite being told no, I didnt need it I actually did file a police report with my local police department, report XXXX was filed with the XXXX Police department for the most recent incident. How are they claiming this is not fraud. Most of these transactions were made during my working hours, and with companies I have never even done business with. They should not be holding me accountable for fraudulent charges, its not my fault their system did not catch these, especially considering I rarely use the card and charges just start coming in back to back on an account thats rarely used. This not acceptable. This was fraud and I did not participate or benefit from the transactions and did what I was supposed to do and notified the credit card company as soon as I learned about the fraud. Not only did the reverse the previously approved fraud they reversed valid fraud charges to the account and closed it!!",

Went through the procedure according to their process and all was well up until XX/XX/XXXX when I responded to WF with additional information to which I was told the claim ( claim # : XXXX ) would be notated and someone would be in contact with me. I never received a call but received documentation in the mail XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my claim had been denied because WF could not find where XXXX was in breach of contract based on the documentation XXXX had provided even though the contract XXXX had provided was not the contract I had signed and differed in multiple ways from the contract I had signed and provided to WF when I submitted my claim on XX/XX/XXXX. Since XXXX I have been calling into WF 's claims department to speak with someone to understand why the additional information I provided to them detailing the differences between contracts as well as additional information that supports my claim that XXXX is in fact in breach of contract and provided fraudulent documentation to WF was not reviewed and why I never received a call back to discuss. Each time I have called I have been told that the claim has been notated and I would receive a call back, usually within 10 business days, to which I have not. WF states the claim can not be reopened with Visa because we are past the 30 day window to respond, however my calls on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and XXXX were within that 30 day window and had WF contacted me like they said they would then WF would have been able to respond to XXXXXXXX XXXX counterclaim. WF mishandled my claim and their responsibility to call me back which I have been told by several of their own representatives in my attempts to speak with them to resolve the issue. I have a detailed timeline of my attempts to speak with WF, notes of the conversations, and phone records to back up this timeline and proof I never received a call back from WF. Every attempt I have made to get clarification from WF as to why I never received a call back, proof they tried to contact me to discuss the questions I have, and if my claim was handled properly has resulted in the same outcome-I am told it is not their responsibility to give me a call back to discuss questions I have and their mail correspondence answered my questions ( it did not, hence why I continued to call in ), they will not verify whether or not I received a call from them prior to XX/XX/XXXX when I escalated my claim to WF 's Executive Office , nor will they confirm my claim was handled properly and all information provided to them reviewed.

He never entered any information on my account and did not remove the hold. I call back on XX/XX/XXXX and transferred to XXXX again and they said my card was not supposed to be allowed by there company to use on cash app and they dont know why it was but that its considered a cash advance and not to use it on cash app again. They then removed the hold. I literally used it the first time I activated it on cash app and had not gotten any fees or holds on the card. I never signed anything saying cash app is a cash advance and was never told it was a fee by anyone and there isnt any faq about cash app or anything stating cash app on the contract or anywhere connected with Ally bank and credit cards. I escalated it to a XXXX and they continue to tell me there system automatically charges cash advance fees and refuse to remove the {$20.00} fee they charged my account when it was literally placed onto my account manually because there is not any fees for cash app purchase on the first one made on my account. They also claim not to have to name specifically cash app as a cash advance because their system does that automatically but doesnt with cash app because the purchase shows as a purchase on their system and not a cash advance.",

I sent a letter to Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. asking them to restore my credit limit or provide additional information explaining the decision. Because of the potential for this change to have a substantially negative impact on my access to credit I am not willing to wait for Bank of America to respond. \n\nI received a letter dated XX/XX/year>, that lists three reasons that Bank of America elected to decrease my credit limit : Current or past delinquency on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates Recent trend in balance on one or more of your accounts, with us and our affiliates, compared to past balance Strength of payment on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates. \n\nAs the letter advised, I immediately reviewed my credit report from XXXX XXXX. Based on the report as of XX/XX/year>, no evidence supports any reasons for reducing my credit limit. There is no indication of any late payments on the credit report, no irregular or rapid increase or decrease in my balance owed, and my payments have been consistent and automatic for many years. When my promotional rate on a portion of my balance recently expired, I ensured that my automated payments increased to cover the new minimums. \n\nThe only recent change that occurred in my relationship with Bank of America or their affiliates was the expiration of my promotional balance transfer rate on a portion of my balance. The expiry is likely the real reason my credit limit decreased. There is no evidence on my credit report supporting the reasons given. As mentioned above, I needed to adjust my payments, and I did so before the XX/XX/XXXX due date, which was more than XXXX days after the date of the XX/XX/XXXX letter informing me of the decision to lower my credit limit. \n\nBecause the decision to lower my credit limit will harm my ability to obtain credit and be used as a basis to either increase my interest rate or further decrease my credit limit. The justifications listed in the XX/XX/XXXX letter do not stand up to even the most cursory inspection of my credit report from XXXX XXXX or any of the other XXXX credit reporting agencies. \n\nThis decision to reduce my credit limit is arbitrary and an attempt to manipulate my financial reputation. At worst, it is a cynical attempt to undo the promotional balance transfer rates Bank of America has previously offered. \n\nI have attached my most current credit reports and the letter I sent to Bank of America.",

The CARD Act mandates that individuals under the age of XXXX must either demonstrate an independent source of funds sufficient to repay any debts incurred with the credit card or have a parent or another person who is at least XXXX XXXX XXXX cosign the credit card. Here is a direct reference to the policy for your convenience : The CARD Act requires people under age XXXX to have a parent or other person who is at least XXXX XXXX XXXX cosign the credit card if they cant demonstrate an independent source of funds sufficient to repay any debts incurred with the credit card. \n\nAt the time this account was opened, I was under the age of XXXX and did not have a cosigner nor the means to independently make payments, which clearly violates both the CARD Act and CFPB regulations. Therefore, the account should never have been approved, and its presence on my credit report is erroneous and damaging. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift resolution of this issue. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \n\nEnclosures : - Previous Correspondence Copy of Identification",

I want Barclays and XXXX to honor the points that were listed on the advertisement as I met the requirements and signed up to get the XXXX points. This seems to be a case of bait and switch. I dont think it is right for a company to offer multiple promotions for the sole purpose of giving the customer the lower reward after signing up for the purpose of receiving the higher XXXX.

            "complaint_what_happened": "Bank of America has been entirely unhelpful and uncooperative in assisting me with recovering fraudulent charges made on my credit card. On the early morning of XX/XX/XXXX, my Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX left my possession and I did not notice. As a frequent XXXX XXXX user, I spent the rest of the day using that credit card from my phone and did not open my wallet ; therefore I did not realize my card was missing. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, at around XXXX XXXX, I looked at my credit card account and the recent charges on it and saw that there were XXXX fraudulent purchases totaling {$960.00} that occurred in the XXXX XXXX area of XXXX primarily on XX/XX/XXXX. I spent that entire day in XXXX. Once I realized my card was stolen, I immediately called Bank of America to lock my card and report the charges as fraud. I spoke to the first customer representative where I went through the nine charges that were fraud. I was told that a fraud specialist would need to handle the fraud claim since there were multiple fraudulent transactions ; I was transferred to the fraud department. In the middle of the transfer, the call hung up. I called back again and spoke with a different representative where I once again went through the fraud transactions, despite telling them that I was told a fraud specialist would need to handle the claim. After going through the transactions again, she confirmed my position and transferred my call. A fraud department representative answered and I then went through the nine separate transactions for a third time. I was told that my claim was successfully submitted. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an update about my claim that stated they were unable to pay it. The document stated that \" We made this decision because : The merchant provided documentation confirming you received the merchandise or service. '' Following this I called back Bank of America to dispute this. On the call I learned that an incorrect, non-fraudulent purchase that I never at any point claimed to be fraud was included on the claim. I asked for that purchase to be removed from the claim. I also asked for the documentation provided by the merchant that confirmed I received the goods or service, but no document was found or sent to me. The claim was resubmitted. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received another update that again said they could not pay the claim. This document provided a list of the fraudulent transactions, and it STILL contained the non-fraud transaction that I asked to be removed. I called Bank of America once again and asked for the transaction to be remove from the account. During this interaction, the representative also informed me that the claim type filed was incorrect and was not accurate if I had lost the physical card. The claim was resubmitted. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the claim was once again denied. Again, the document stated that \" We made this decision because : The merchant provided documentation confirming you received the merchandise or service. '' When asked for the documentation or other information used to come to this decision, none could be provided to me. I called and asked for the claim to be resubmitted. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the claim was denied again. Additionally, this document once again had the incorrect, non-fraudulent purchase on the claim. The document stated that \" We made this decision because : The merchant provided documentation confirming you received the merchandise or service. '' This documentation or other information was not provided to me. I called and asked for the claim to be resubmitted. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the claim was denied once again. The document again stated that \" We made this decision because : The merchant provided documentation confirming you received the merchandise or service. '' This documentation or other information was not provided to me. I called the representative within the fraud department and was told that this decision was made because : 1 ) I had used XXXX to use the card to pay for purchase while the fraud was occurring 2 ) I had opened my bank app on XX/XX/XXXX during the fraud events, but had not called to report fraud at the time. My rationale and defense for this is : I did not open my wallet the entire day I was using XXXX where I would have noticed the card to be missing. Additionally, when I open my bank app, the first accounts I see are for my checking and savings account. To see the charges for my credit card, I would have to deliberately scroll to the bottom on the page and then click on the account to see the charge details. I had used the app to XXXX someone via my checking account ; therefore I would not have seen the fraudulent purchases. I also did not receive proof that I had looked at the detailed credit charges of my account when the fraudulent purchases would have been present. I asked for the claim to be re-submitted. \n\nAs a Bank of America XXXX since XXXX, I am extremely disappointed with this customer service and assistance with this issue. I have spent hours dealing with this and speaking to Bank of America employees, yet I still have not received a satisfactory resolution. I have not been asked to provide, at any point, any supporting evidence or documentation that confirms I did not make these purchases. Time and time again, I asked for the evidence that Bank of America is using to come to the determination that fraud did not occur and have not received anything. I believe that the initial issues associated with the claim ( incorrect non-fraudulent transaction and incorrect claim type ), are actively hurting resubmissions of the claim to this day, despite being problems that were not my fault. While the representatives that I have spoken with have been kind, a small handful have actually been helpful and some I believe have hurt my claim. I have filed a report to the police department to investigate this fraud and am attaching a photo of the initial intake form. I am working to get the full police report.",

After I did that Bank of America reduced my credit limit multiple times even though all payments were made timely through auto-withdrawal. One payment was delayed for a few days because I had to close a checking account and reopen another due to fraud. \n\nEvery time they reduce the credit limit it negatively impacts my credit report and credit score. This should not be legal if a consumer has paid timely with no issue with the company. \n\nThe company basically is providing misleading information. I have spoken to the company and they indicated that the only thing I could do was to request that my credit limit be increased back to what it was and they may or may not grant it.\n\nI would ask that my credit limit be increased back to what was originally provided so that it does not negatively indicate my credit report by reducing my available credit. I feel that I was taken advantage of by utilizing bait and switch by providing a certain credit limit. I would not have switched companies if I had known they were going to do this and would subsequent negatively impact my credit.",
